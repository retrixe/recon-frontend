# recon-frontend

A frontend for the ReConsole Minecraft console.

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` in the top level of the project and then add the following content:

```json
{
  "ip": "<insert absolute (with http) IP to the server running the ReConsole plugin here>"
}
```

Note: port 4200 should be open on your server, with the IP not having `/` at the end.
